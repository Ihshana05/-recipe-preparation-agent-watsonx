# 🍽️ Recipe Preparation Agent using IBM Watsonx Agentic AI

This AI-powered cooking assistant helps users prepare meals using only the ingredients they have on hand.  
Built using **IBM Watsonx Agentic AI**, it suggests recipes, substitutions, and dietary tips — tailored to your preferences — all without requiring a dataset.
